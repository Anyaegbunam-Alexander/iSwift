## iSwift

A concept API for a fintech app/webapp where customers can transfer and receive payments swiftly :).

What makes iswift standout is there is no need for customers to memorize random digits as account numbers. They just use the digits they are familiar with, their phone number.
Therefore, customers can receive and send money with just their phone numbers.

Other features includes

- Savings feature to help customers save
- Ability for customers to add a product and different prices for the product
- Ability to generate a QR code or payment link for a customer to swiftly accept payment or transfer from another customer

Awesome!!
